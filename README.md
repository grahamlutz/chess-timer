## Chess Timer

* All markup, styles, and scripts contained in a single index.html file as requested.
* Javascript is self-documenting.
* Minimun styles were used to make the app usable - more can be added as required by design team.
* Clock counts down in 1 second increments - this can be changed to tenths or hundreths of seconds, while maintaining reasonable accuracy on a 4 minute time scale, should technical requirements dictate.

## Business Requirements

You are apart of a brand new startup that specializes in chess!  You’ve been assigned a task to make a speed timer when a game of chess is happening.  The business requirements are as follows:

* There needs to be two clocks, one for each player.
* Each clock has one button.
* By pressing your button you start the other players clock and stop yours if it’s counting down (the opposite of this is also true).
* Each clock starts at 4 minutes and counts down until one of them reaches 0.
* When the application loads, no clocks will be active (each clock will be at 4 minutes).
* When a clock reaches 0, reset each clock back to 4 minutes and award the game to the other player (you can use an alert or console logging).
* There is a reset button that can reset both clocks back to 4 minutes and set the buttons back to their original state.


## Technical Requirements

* Make sure that the code are as reusable as possible.
* You are not allowed to use any libraries or frameworks.  This project should be done in vanilla Javascript.
* If you use ES6 you must supply us with your own compilation script.
* Feel free to use Git if you’d like.
* There should be one index.html file for us to load.

Please provide us a README with your assumptions or other notes that you would like us to know.  Your code will be reviewed in modern Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers.
